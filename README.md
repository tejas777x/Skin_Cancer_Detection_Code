# ** Skin Cancer Detection **



Skin cancer is the most common human malignancy and is primarily diagnosed visually and it involves a sheer amount of time and technicalities.
Deep learning can automate this diagnosis process,thus eliminating human error and saving million of  lives.

-Deep learning has been shown to produce competitive results in medical diagnosis
-This project is built to detect skin cancer at an early stage using deep convolutional neural networks.
-This model detects 7 categories of skin cancer:


1. Melanocytic nevi 
2. Melanoma
3. Benign keratosis-like lesions
4. Basal cell carcinoma
5. Actinic keratoses
6. Vascular lesions
7. Dermatofibroma. 

### For this project we used the HAM10000 ("Human Against Machine with 10000 training images") dataset

### WE used the EfficientNetB3 Architecture  

## Our model was abel to produce an accuracy score over 80%
